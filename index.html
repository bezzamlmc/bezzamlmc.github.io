    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a software developer based in Silicon Valley.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I have a Computer Science degree from the University of Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p align=center>I am always up for a challenge. I grew up watching scinence ficition: Start Trek, Star Wars, Lost in Space ...<br>
       Science fiction inspired me to study computer science because I thought it would give me the tools to explore and solve problems. It certainly did!<br>
        I went far and beyond. I started my career setting up computational resources and writing algorithms for economists in Argentina.<br>
        In Italy I taught physicists from all over the world to use software to build lab tools along CERN engineers.<br> In Silicon Valley I joined an engineering company 
        and worked on virtual prototyping for oil exploration, medical ultrasound and NDE.<br>
        I touched all aspects of software development from design to deployment and collaborated with teams around the globe including Scotland and India.<br>
